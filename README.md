# 🛡️ Fin-Vision: The AI Fraud Sentinel
> *A Real-Time Computer Vision System for Financial Document Forensics*

## 💡 The Problem
Financial fraud costs the global economy billions annually. Traditional methods of verifying checks, ID cards, and financial documents rely on slow manual review or expensive proprietary hardware.

## 🚀 The Solution
**Fin-Vision** is a lightweight, AI-powered forensic tool that uses Computer Vision to detect forgery artifacts in real-time. It analyzes:
1. **Blur Variance:** Detecting low-quality scans often used in quick forgery.
2. **Edge Density:** Verifying the texture and fiber details of authentic paper documents.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Core:** Python 3.10+
* **CV Engine:** OpenCV (Computer Vision)
* **UI/Frontend:** Streamlit
* **Math:** NumPy

## ⚡ How to Run
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   `pip install streamlit opencv-python-headless numpy`
3. Run the app:
   `python -m streamlit run main.py`
