## The Problem
Financial fraud costs the global economy billions annually. Traditional methods of verifying checks, ID cards, and financial documents rely on slow manual review or expensive proprietary hardware.

## The Solution
**Fin-Vision** is a lightweight, AI-powered forensic tool that uses Computer Vision to detect forgery artifacts in real-time. It analyzes:
1. **Blur Variance:** Detecting low-quality scans often used in quick forgery.
2. **Edge Density:** Verifying the texture and fiber details of authentic paper documents.

## Tech Stack
* **Core:** Python 3.10+
* **CV Engine:** OpenCV (Computer Vision)
* **UI/Frontend:** Streamlit
* **Math:** NumPy

## How to Run Locally
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the app:
   `python -m streamlit run main.py`

## Connects To
This project is part of a larger security ecosystem including **Ghost-Buster (Data Fraud)** and **ResQ-Node (Emergency Response)**, building a complete safety net for digital and physical infrastructures.
